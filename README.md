## Storytelling

The premise is a competing company has stolen very-important.zip
Explain infiltrating the company on the day of their migration to the new portal
Hacker Liason has stolen API keys to log us in

The flags found after a hack are actually clues themselves


## Intro

A team based game of capture the flag for 25+ participants
where a whole slew of vulnerable services and websites are being spun up

Some sort of hacking is required before the system surrenders the flag
and you progress in the game.

infused with security sensibility presentations
and demos of hacking tools.

With the ultimate goal of being crowned best hacking team.
