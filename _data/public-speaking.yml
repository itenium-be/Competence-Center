    At ReactJS Brussels, Wouter Van Schandevijl from Itenium discussed 
    how React component profiling boosts performance by identifying and
    minimizing slow or redundant renders. Using React DevTools Profiler, 
    he highlighted techniques like memoization and hooks 
    (`React.memo`, `useCallback`) to manage state and optimize component 
    rendering, resulting in a more responsive and efficient user experience.
