  date: 2024-06-20
  track: "ArchitectureTrack"
  summary: >
   Another great session in our ArchitectureTrack packed
   with examples, best practices, and real-world applications.
   We had a great time exploring how to design flexible,
   maintainable, and scalable systems.
   <br><br>
   Key takeaways included an exploration of N-tier Architecture,
   which divides an application into layers (Presentation,
   Business Logic, Data Access, etc.) to enhance separation of
   concerns and scalability, and Hexagonal Architecture
   (Ports and Adapters), which emphasizes the use of ports and
   adapters to decouple core business logic from external systems,
   allowing for easy integration and adaptability.
   Stay tuned for more insightful talks!

  subTitle: War-Story on React component performance.
  date: 2023-03-09
  summary: >
    In React Component Profiling, we improved the frontend performance of an internal itenium application
    (10s -> 120ms) by tackling some nasty dependencies (the npm package for calculating a holiday loaded 10MB JS,
    our AuthService that accessed localStorage repeatedly, ...) after which we did further analysis using the
    Profiler Chrome Extension & <Profiler /> component, and got to the x10 performance by restructuring the store
    and using React features like memo, useMemo and introducing a new library reselect.

    Last Monday, we continued our frontend adventure with a hands-on session of Reactive Programming using RXJS😎

    but only after retrieving/refreshing a JWT token and which responded to changes in filters and pagination.
    <br><br>Once there, it was time to integrate it all into an Angular app.

    The importance of UnitTesting cannot be overstated. We're all on our way to become senior developers
    and architects. One of the responsibilities as the architect in the team is incorporating UnitTesting
    in the development process. This includes being able to explain what UnitTesting is to juniors, as well
    as communicating best practices, configuring the CI, convincing management of the added value and more.
