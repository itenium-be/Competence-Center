    This was proven last week when we had our tech event covering our very own RegEx Tutorial.
    We explored a world of possibilities where we conquered the art of pattern matching and text manipulation through practical examples and exercises.
    Our team's coding prowess soars some more!

Understanding the vulnerabilities of the business and our strengths are the ways that help us in tackling any roadblocks that stand in our way. It's always crucial to be aware and prepared. This was demonstrated during our Security Bootcamp where we explored the world of hacking and learned to defend against them. We recently revisited the hacks that were presented and it was mind-expanding how these sometimes simple exploits lead to a bigger problem. The team's Security Awareness reaches another level!"

  date: 2023-03-09
  summary: >
    In React Component Profiling, we improved the frontend performance of an internal itenium application
    (10s -> 120ms) by tackling some nasty dependencies (the npm package for calculating a holiday loaded 10MB JS,
    our AuthService that accessed localStorage repeatedly, ...) after which we did further analysis using the
    Profiler Chrome Extension & <Profiler /> component, and got to the x10 performance by restructuring the store
    and using React features like memo, useMemo and introducing a new library reselect.

  summary: >
    Last Monday, we continued our frontend adventure with a hands-on session of Reactive Programming using RXJS😎
    <br>We solved incrementally more difficult challenges until we ended up with an Observable that called a REST API
    but only after retrieving/refreshing a JWT token and which responded to changes in filters and pagination.
    <br><br>Once there, it was time to integrate it all into an Angular app.

    The importance of UnitTesting cannot be overstated. We're all on our way to become senior developers
    and architects. One of the responsibilities as the architect in the team is incorporating UnitTesting
    in the development process. This includes being able to explain what UnitTesting is to juniors, as well
    as communicating best practices, configuring the CI, convincing management of the added value and more.
