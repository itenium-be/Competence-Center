    We believe that quality is not a one-time achievement but an ongoing commitment.
    This is why we invest time and effort in making sure that our consultants' skills are always in top shape.
    With guidance and constant development, there is so much potential that can be unlocked.
    This was proven last week when we had our tech event covering our very own RegEx Tutorial.
    We explored a world of possibilities where we conquered the art of pattern matching and text manipulation
    through practical examples and exercises.
    Our team's coding prowess soars some more!

    We leave no stone unturned in our pursuit of quality. We ensure that every product and service reflects our
    unwavering dedication to delivering the best.
    Understanding the vulnerabilities of the business and our strengths are the ways that help us in tackling any
    roadblocks that stand in our way. It's always crucial to be aware and prepared.
    This was demonstrated during our Security Bootcamp where we explored the world of hacking and learned to
    defend against them. We recently revisited the hacks that were presented and it was mind-expanding how these
    sometimes simple exploits lead to a bigger problem. The team's Security Awareness reaches another level!"

  summary: >
    In React Component Profiling, we improved the frontend performance of an internal itenium application
    (10s -> 120ms) by tackling some nasty dependencies (the npm package for calculating a holiday loaded 10MB JS,
    our AuthService that accessed localStorage repeatedly, ...) after which we did further analysis using the
    Profiler Chrome Extension & <Profiler /> component, and got to the x10 performance by restructuring the store
    and using React features like memo, useMemo and introducing a new library reselect.
