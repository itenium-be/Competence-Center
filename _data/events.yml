  summary: >
    A regex intro so gentle it doesn't even contain a regex. We pinky promise, it won't hurt!
    As a prelude to our upcoming technical session "RegularExpressions" we published the first of a series on regex.
    This introduction answers the question: "Why learn regex?" while also warning of some pitfalls.
    But mostly it's just an excuse to post some insanely funny regex memes (don't be a killjoy)

  subTitle: War-Story on React component performance.
  date: 2023-03-09
  summary: >
    In React Component Profiling, we improved the frontend performance of an internal itenium application
    (10s -> 120ms) by tackling some nasty dependencies (the npm package for calculating a holiday loaded 10MB JS,
    our AuthService that accessed localStorage repeatedly, ...) after which we did further analysis using the
    Profiler Chrome Extension & <Profiler /> component, and got to the x10 performance by restructuring the store
    and using React features like memo, useMemo and introducing a new library reselect.

  date: 2022-09-26
  summary: >
    Last Monday, we continued our frontend adventure with a hands-on session of Reactive Programming using RXJS😎
    <br>We solved incrementally more difficult challenges until we ended up with an Observable that called a REST API
    but only after retrieving/refreshing a JWT token and which responded to changes in filters and pagination.
    <br><br>Once there, it was time to integrate it all into an Angular app.

  summary: >
    The importance of UnitTesting cannot be overstated. We're all on our way to become senior developers
    and architects. One of the responsibilities as the architect in the team is incorporating UnitTesting
    in the development process. This includes being able to explain what UnitTesting is to juniors, as well
    as communicating best practices, configuring the CI, convincing management of the added value and more.
