    After a well-earned summer break, the Itenium crew is back — recharged,
    slightly more tanned, and ready to turn caffeine into code again.
    <br>
    But first it was time to unleash our inner archers! 🏹
    <br><br>
    We headed to Aalst for Arrow Tag: two teams, bows and plenty of action. 💥 
    <br><br>
    From tactical battles to hilarious muddy moments—it turned into an evening 
    full of teamwork, adrenaline, and fun.
    <br><br>
    And of course, we wrapped it up with drinks at the bar to relive the highlights. 
    🍻 3... 2... 1... shoot!

  summary: >
    Last Wednesday, we tackled "Requirements Elicitation" 
    in a hands-on workshop—exploring the what, why, and how 
    of gathering requirements effectively. 
    <br><br> 
    Teams evaluated 12 techniques and answered key questions:
    <br>✔️ Participants: Who’s involved?
    <br>✔️ Preparation & Process: How much effort does it take?
    <br>✔️ Outcome & Quality: What’s the ROI of the info?
    <br>✔️ Star Rating: 1-5 —how well does it actually work for requirements?
    <br><br>
    Spoiler: Apprenticing, Contextual inquiry and Prototyping s
    cored high, while some methods (looking at you, system archaeology) 
    proved… niche. 
    <br><br>
    🐒 The inside joke? "Find the wet monkey"—a.k.a. hunting for that 
    rare business expert who still knows why things are done the way they are.
    <br>🛠️ Bonus round: We shared tools we’ve used in the wild—because 
    even the best technique needs the right tech!
    <br>💡 Key takeaway? No one-size-fits-all. The best analysts mix methods.
    <br><br>
    What’s your go-to requirements elicitation technique?

    ✅ Unit Testing Theory – Recap Done Right
    <br><br>
    Before diving into code, we zoomed through the why of testing: 
    <br>🧠 Boundary Value Analysis
    <br>🔃 State vs Behavior testing 
    <br>🧍 Solitary vs Social tests 
    <br>📏 Coverage ≠ Quality (branch > line)
    <br>⚡ Quick feedback loops 
    <br>🧪 Test Doubles & Mocking 
    <br>🏗️ Testing legacy code without losing your mind
    <br>📐 TDD & the FIRST + AAA principles 
    <br>🚩 Common pitfalls (and how to dodge them)
    <br><br>
    And remember:
    If your tests don’t run on CI… you might as well not have any. 😅

    Office Day with Learning Lunch

    Last week, we switched things up with an Office Day 
    at Itenium HQ in Mechelen! While continuing our work 
    for clients, it was great to spend the day together in 
    person — a nice break from our usual remote and on-site 
    routines.
    <br><br>
    Over lunch, we kicked off our Testing Track — a new internal 
    learning series focused on sharpening our testing practices. 
    We explored how to structure tests efficiently across unit, 
    integration, and end-to-end layers. We discussed best practices, 
    trade-offs, and how to avoid common pitfalls like overly relying 
    on UI tests or skipping unit coverage.
    <br><br>
    A valuable knowledge-sharing moment — and only the beginning!

    Boekenclub Session #2: Diving Deeper into Pattern Hatching – Chapter 2!
    <br><br>
    Last time, we tackled an Object-Oriented FileSystem using Composite, Proxy, and Visitor patterns. This week, we leveled up by implementing multi-user security with:
    <br>  🔹 Template Method to standardize access control logic.
    <br>  🔹 Singleton for a centralized security manager.
    <br>  🔹 Mediator to streamline user-permission interactions.
    <br><br>
    Key takeaway? Patterns aren’t just theory; they’re tools to solve messy design problems elegantly.
    Shoutout to everyone who joined—your insights made this even richer!

    <br>✅ Building alignment with your stakeholders
    <br>✅ Communicating your message with clarity and confidence
    <br>✅ Navigating resistance and handling conflict effectively
    <br><br>
    The session sparked great discussions and gave us practical 
    tools to apply immediately in our roles.

  by: "Bert Vervaele"
  date: 2025-03-28
  track: "Bootcamp"
  summary: >
    The itenium bootcamp this year was all about "Home Automation".
    We kicked things off, as tradition goes, with breakfast,
    followed by the legendary "SMART HOUSE - REMA 1000" clip,
    a perfect reminder that maybe not everything should be
    automated.
    <br><br>
    Then it was time to get hands-on: teams like the Burnt
    Fingers Club and The Sparkonauts brought the heat -- literally,
    as they went about soldering their own smart sockets.
    <br><br>
    After dinner, we took things up a notch as we hooked the
    sockets and our sensor-loaded mini-houses to Home Assistant
    via one of the Raspberries. From the Cloud Cottage or
    The Overengineered Hut, everyone got a taste of smart living.
    <br><br>
    From solder fumes to smart rooms -- fueled by good vibes,
    snacks, and a closing reception. Till next year!

  summary: >
    This week, we dove into the first chapters of "Pattern Hatching"
    by John Vlissides (GoF author). We tackled common misconceptions
    about Design Patterns and explored a real-world OO FileSystem using:
    <br><br>
    - Composite
    <br>- Proxy
    <br>- Visitor (the most intriguing—and potentially dangerous—pattern
    of the night!)
    <br><br>
    We compared a C# implementation with Julia’s multiple dispatch,
    sparking debate: Are design patterns just missing language features?
    <br><br>
    Great discussion—excited for the next session!

  date: 2024-10-17
  track: "ArchitectureTrack"
  summary: >
    Our latest ArchitectureTrack session covered "Microservices Patterns"
    from Chris Richardson. Highlighting the huge advantages of a Microservice
    architecture while also being a cautionary tale: there are significant
    obstacles to overcome before you can be successful with them; and building
    a monolith with for example a hexagonal architecture could just be much
    better for your team(s)!
    <br><br>
    That being said, "<i>if you find yourself in a hole, stop digging</i>",
    we discussed how it's typically best to start with a monolith but how you
    can refactor towards microservices using different strategies and what
    application and infrastructure patterns you need to apply to avoid every
    outage being like a murder mystery.
    <br><br>
    Some of the topics covered:
    <ul>
    <li>Interprocess communication: to API or to message? How to handle the missing Isolation in your beloved ACID?</li>
    <li>Queries: API composition or reporting databases (with EventSourcing)</li>
    <li>Getting production ready: security, configurability and observability</li>
    <li>Deployment: needs to be highly automated -- what are your options</li>
    </ul>

  track: "QAEvent"
  summary: >
    The game that was the SQL Training started with a hickup,
    other machines were not discoverable on the guest network
    so the leaderboard server had to be deployed on an external
    server -- while everyone was already solving exercises! This
    messed up our scoreboard considerably, especially the ranking
    for "solved fastest" 😊
    <br><br>
    After this it was pretty smooth sailing. Tom found an error in
    the calculation of the query to calculate the average GDP per
    capita in South America. That and other small issues were fixed
    on the spot, on production -- as it should! 😉
    <br><br>
    Even though we had definitely said "no cheating", Alexander came
    to the correct amount of penalties by doing <code>COUNT(0)+4</code>
    and Mike found the countries with a GDP > Europe by doing
    <code>WHERE GDP>3425956000000</code>. Straight to jail!
    <br><br>
    In the end Michael proved too strong and with 63 points, he went
    home with the title of itenium SQL Master and the gaming cup!

   We had a great time exploring how to design flexible,

   <br><br>
   Key takeaways included an exploration of N-tier Architecture,
   which divides an application into layers (Presentation,
   Business Logic, Data Access, etc.) to enhance separation of
   concerns and scalability, and Hexagonal Architecture
   (Ports and Adapters), which emphasizes the use of ports and
   adapters to decouple core business logic from external systems,
   allowing for easy integration and adaptability.

    The importance of UnitTesting cannot be overstated. We're all on our way to become senior developers
    and architects. One of the responsibilities as the architect in the team is incorporating UnitTesting
    in the development process. This includes being able to explain what UnitTesting is to juniors, as well
    as communicating best practices, configuring the CI, convincing management of the added value and more.

    The microkernel architecture revolutionized software design
    by stripping down the core and letting most services run separately.
    This clever approach made systems more stable and flexible, making
    updates a breeze and reducing the chances of a meltdown. Think of it
    as the minimalist superhero of software architecture—lean, adaptable,
    and always ready for action!
