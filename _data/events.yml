  summary: >
    Last Monday, we continued our frontend adventure with a hands-on session of Reactive Programming using RXJSðŸ˜Ž
    <br>We solved incrementally more difficult challenges until we ended up with an Observable that called a REST API but only after retrieving/refreshing a JWT token and which responded to changes in filters and pagination.
    <br><br>Once there, it was time to integrate it all into an Angular app.

    The importance of UnitTesting cannot be overstated. We're all on our way to become senior developers
    and architects. One of the responsibilities as the architect in the team is incorporating UnitTesting
    in the development process. This includes being able to explain what UnitTesting is to juniors, as well
    as communicating best practices, configuring the CI, convincing management of the added value and more.
