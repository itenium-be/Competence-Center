Understanding the vulnerabilities of the business and our strengths are the ways that help us in tackling any roadblocks that stand in our way. It's always crucial to be aware and prepared. This was demonstrated during our Security Bootcamp where we explored the world of hacking and learned to defend against them. We recently revisited the hacks that were presented and it was mind-expanding how these sometimes simple exploits lead to a bigger problem. The team's Security Awareness reaches another level!"

    In React Component Profiling, we improved the frontend performance of an internal itenium application
    (10s -> 120ms) by tackling some nasty dependencies (the npm package for calculating a holiday loaded 10MB JS,
    our AuthService that accessed localStorage repeatedly, ...) after which we did further analysis using the
    Profiler Chrome Extension & <Profiler /> component, and got to the x10 performance by restructuring the store
    and using React features like memo, useMemo and introducing a new library reselect.

    Last Monday, we continued our frontend adventure with a hands-on session of Reactive Programming using RXJS😎

    but only after retrieving/refreshing a JWT token and which responded to changes in filters and pagination.
    <br><br>Once there, it was time to integrate it all into an Angular app.

    as communicating best practices, configuring the CI, convincing management of the added value and more.
